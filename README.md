# cornerstone-project
This is a BDD framework. I've used Cucumber and Gherkin to design and prioritise the test cases. Selenium Webdriver is used to interact with the web element.

I've used the Page Object Model design pattern for managing the web element locators and Maven build tool to manage dependencies.

Junit is used to run the project

For test validation, Junit assertions are used 

For the automation report, I have a cucumber report

Test data is generated using the Java faker library 

The Lombok project library is used for managing logs and class Getters and Setters
